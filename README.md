# Hands-on Practice Lab: Model Development - Laptop Price Prediction

In this project, I applied **linear regression principles** to build a **prediction model** that estimates the **price of a laptop** based on one or more attributes from the dataset.  
This was a **hands-on practice lab** where I implemented the complete process, including **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization**.

## **Objectives**

After completing this project, I was able to:

- Use **linear regression** to predict **laptop prices**.
- Preprocess data and handle missing values effectively.
- Build and evaluate multiple regression models.
- Visualize data and model performance using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
- Understand how to use different features to improve prediction accuracy.

## **Project Overview**

This lab focused on developing a **laptop price prediction model** using the **linear regression algorithm**.  
The goal was to analyze how different **attributes** of laptops (like processor, RAM, storage, and brand) affect their prices and predict **accurate price ranges**.

### **Steps Followed**

1. **Setup and Imports**
   - Installed and imported all required libraries.
   - Prepared the environment for data analysis and model training.

2. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Checked for missing values and handled them properly.
   - Selected relevant features for model building.
   - Converted categorical variables into numeric form if necessary.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Used **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to:
     - Visualize feature relationships.
     - Understand price distribution.
     - Identify correlations between attributes and price.

4. **Model Development**
   - Implemented **Simple Linear Regression**.
   - Built a **Multiple Linear Regression** model.
   - Optimized the model using feature selection and transformations.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated model performance using:
     - **R² Score**
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
     - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
   - Compared results for better accuracy.

6. **Price Prediction**
   - Predicted laptop prices based on provided input features.
